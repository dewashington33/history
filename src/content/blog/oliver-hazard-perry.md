**Oliver Hazard Perry** (born August 23, 1785, South Kingston, [Rhode Island](https://www.britannica.com/place/Rhode-Island-state), U.S.—died August 23, 1819, at sea) U.S. naval officer who became a national hero when he defeated a British squadron in the [Battle of Lake Erie](https://www.britannica.com/event/Battle-of-Lake-Erie) in the [War of 1812](https://www.britannica.com/event/War-of-1812).

Appointed a midshipman at 14, [Perry](https://www.britannica.com/place/Perry-county-Pennsylvania) served in both the [West Indies](https://www.britannica.com/place/West-Indies-island-group-Atlantic-Ocean) and the Mediterranean until February 1813, when he was sent to [Erie](https://www.britannica.com/place/Erie-Pennsylvania), Pennsylvania, to complete the building of a U.S. squadron to challenge British control of the [Great Lakes](https://www.britannica.com/place/Great-Lakes).

By early autumn he had assembled a [fleet](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/fleet) of 10 small vessels and was ready to engage the enemy. When the battle was joined on September 10, Perry’s fleet was greatly superior in short-range firepower but only slightly superior at long range; a light wind prevented him from closing in quickly on the six British warships commanded by Capt. Robert Heriot Barclay. When Perry’s flagship, the _Lawrence_, was disabled, he transferred to the _Niagara_ and won the battle within the next 15 minutes by sailing directly into the British line, firing broadside. In his official report of the British surrender, Perry wrote, “We have met the enemy and they are ours. Two [ships](https://www.britannica.com/technology/naval-ship), two [brigs](https://www.britannica.com/technology/brig-ship), one [schooner](https://www.britannica.com/technology/schooner), and one [sloop](https://www.britannica.com/technology/sloop).”

Perry’s successful action at [Lake Erie](https://www.britannica.com/place/Lake-Erie) helped ensure U.S. control of the Northwest; it also raised him to a position of national [eminence](https://www.britannica.com/dictionary/eminence) and earned him promotion to the rank of captain. He commanded the _Java_ in the [Mediterranean](https://www.britannica.com/place/Mediterranean-Sea) (1816–17) and a small U.S. fleet sent to the South Atlantic (1819) to bring under control certain vessels that were preying on American shipping out of [Buenos Aires](https://www.britannica.com/place/Buenos-Aires) and [Venezuela](https://www.britannica.com/place/Venezuela). On the return trip he contracted [yellow fever](https://www.britannica.com/science/yellow-fever) and died.
